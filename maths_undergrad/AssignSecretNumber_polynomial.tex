Charles secretly assigns non-negative integers $A,B,C$ to genius students Issac, Tommy and David respectively. For example, Issac only knows the value of $A$ in the beginning of the conversation, but not the value of $B$ or $C$. Tommy only knows the value of $B$ and David only knows the value of $C$. The goal is to deduce $A,B,C$ correctly by themselves. \\[5pt]
\textbf{David:}\\ $C$ is prime! \\[3pt]
\textbf{Tommy:} \\I don't know whether the polynomial $x^3+Ax^2+Bx+C$ has repeated integer roots. \\[3pt]
\textbf{David:} \\The polynomial $x^3+Ax^2+Cx+k$ has no repeated integer roots for any positive number $k$. \\[3pt]
\textbf{Issac:}\\ I don't know whether the polynomial $x^3+Ax^2+Bx+C$ has integer root(s). \\[10pt]
Charles gives the final hint that the polynomial $x^3+6Cx^2+(A-2)x+2B$ has $3$ integer roots.
Based on the information from the conversation above, find $A$, $B$ and $C$. Explain your answer clearly.
